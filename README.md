# platform-demo
## Goal
My goal with this project is to create a small platform leveraging cloud providers:
- Provision an EKS cluster with terraform
- Deploy ArgoCD into the cluster
  - Bootstrap ArgoCD
- ArgoCD to Deploy CrossPlane and CrossPlane resources

## Usage of ArgoCD & CrossPlane:
Build a GitOps based platform that can deploy applications and cloud resources for them on-demand
